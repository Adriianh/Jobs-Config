Well... i know what it's like not to be able to pay for something you may need, that's why i decided to make it free for those who want it and know how to get it.

  	• Select your favorite color scheme and copy the folders.
	• Put the files in the respective folders.
		- Menus in "plugins/TrMenu/menus"

  	• Restart your server. NEVER DO /RELOAD.

	• Download the resourcepack if you want to use custom fonts/icons.
